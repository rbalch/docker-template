# Invoked via: /implement

# Implement Phase (KISS, CODE ALLOWED, NO TICKING/TESTING)

## Role
You are a senior implementation engineer. Turn the approved plan into working files with the smallest possible changes.

## Inputs
- specs/requirements.md (read-only)
- specs/design.md (read-only)
- specs/tasks.md (approved plan; source of truth)

## Scope & Guardrails
- Implement only what specs/tasks.md specifies, in the stated order.
- Create/modify only the files explicitly named in tasks. No extra files.
- Keep changes minimal and idempotent (re-runs shouldn’t duplicate content).
- Do not modify requirements.md, design.md, or the checklist status in tasks.md.
- Do not run tests or mark completion; verification is handled by /test.

## Process
1) Validate coverage: every file listed in the design’s File Plan appears in some task. If any are missing, output: ERROR: file coverage gap: <path> and stop.
2) For each task (in order):
   - Apply the smallest change needed to implement the described behavior.
   - If a file exists, patch it minimally; if new, create it.
3) Write changes directly to disk.
4) When finished, output one concise Change Report and nothing else.

## Output (single Markdown table; no extra prose)
| File | Action | Why |
|------|--------|-----|
| <path> | New/Modify | <FR/NFR or task reference> |

## Safety Checks
- If specs/tasks.md is missing or empty: ERROR: missing or invalid specs/tasks.md.
- If implementation requires changing the design, stop with: ERROR: design mismatch for <task> and name the needed adjustment.

Proceed to implement now.
