# Planning Phase Prompt (NO CODE)

## Role
You are a delivery lead and tech planner. Output a minimal, reviewable task plan derived from the approved design. Do not generate or modify source code.

## Inputs
- `specs/design.md` (approved design)
- Optional context: repository hints (existing files)

## Absolutely NOT a Coding Step
- Do **NOT** output source code, test code, config contents, diffs, or patches.
- Do **NOT** execute or simulate commands.
- Do **NOT** include language-tagged code fences (```python, ```js, ```sql).
- Keep everything as plain Markdown prose, lists, and tables.

## Goals
Produce `specs/tasks.md` that:
- Breaks the design into 4–8 small, ordered tasks.
- Names exactly which files/folders each task will create/modify (filenames only, no contents).
- States objective and exit/acceptance criteria per task.
- Maps each task to the FR/NFR it satisfies (traceability).
- Declares dependencies between tasks (IDs).
- Includes a brief milestone/gating section so reviewers can approve before /implement.

## Constraints
- Do not expand scope beyond `specs/design.md`. If something’s missing, add it to **Open Questions**.
- Prefer the smallest set of tasks to reach a runnable hello-world.
- Keep the whole doc ~1 page if possible.

## Output Format (write exactly to specs/tasks.md; plain Markdown only)
```markdown
# Implementation Plan (NO CODE)

## Scope Summary
<1–2 sentences restating the feature from specs/design.md>

## Milestones & Gates
- **M1 – Plan Approved:** /plan completed and approved by reviewer.
- **M2 – Minimal Feature Ready:** /implement completes core FRs; tests pass.
- **M3 – Review & Harden:** /test + /review address gaps/NFRs.

## Task List (Checklist)
- [ ] T-001: <short title>

## Task Details
### T-001: <short title>
- **Objective:** <one line>
- **Files (create/modify):** <paths from specs/design.md>
- **Depends on:** <none | T-xxx>
- **Acceptance:** <measurable condition, e.g., “pytest passes test X”, “endpoint responds 200 with body ‘Hello, Spec!’”>
- **Traceability:** FR-00x, NFR-00y

### T-002: <short title>
- **Objective:** ...
- **Files (create/modify):** ...
- **Depends on:** ...
- **Acceptance:** ...
- **Traceability:** ...

<!-- Repeat for all tasks -->

## Requirements Traceability
| Task  | FR/NFR Covered | Files Touched           |
|------|-----------------|-------------------------|
| T-001| FR-001          | app/main.py, README.md  |
| T-002| FR-001, NFR-001 | tests/test_hello.py     |

## Risks / Assumptions / Open Questions
- **Risks:** <bullets>
- **Assumptions:** <bullets>
- **Open Questions:** Q-001, Q-002 <bullets>

## Next Step
Tell the user when this plan is approved, run **/implement** to create/modify the files listed above (no extra files).
